# How does it work?
A user can search for a city. Then it is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 
ThenN the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
Also, it is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

If the user clicks on a city in the search history, then the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

if the UV index is green, the UV index is favorable. It is orange is moderate or red is severe.
